# Namvinh's First Repo
This repo was made for the first assignment in ENMA165.

## Repo Setup Choices
- I chose to make the repo public so that it would be easier to share with others.  
- I initiated the repo with a README so there would be documentation from the start.  
- I chose No. gitignore because I'm not coding anything yet.  
- I chose the MIT license because it's the simplest.  

## Important Notice
> [!WARNING]
> :warning: This repo was created by a ***total* novice** who is unsure as to what he is doing half of the time.  
> Said novice is learning from Dr. @guyer in ENMA165 at UMD.
