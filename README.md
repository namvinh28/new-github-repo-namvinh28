# Namvinh's First Repo
This repo was made for the first assignment in ENMA165.

## Repo Setup Choices
I chose to make the repo public so that it would be easier to share with others.  
I initiated the repo with a README so there would be documentation from the start.  
I chose No. gitignore because I'm not coding anything yet.  
I chose the MIT license because it's the simplest.
